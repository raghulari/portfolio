# Portfolio

A macOS-inspired interactive portfolio that simulates a desktop-like environment directly in the browser.  
Designed to demonstrate advanced frontend engineering concepts such as window lifecycle management, animation orchestration, and global state control.

---

## ✨ Features

- macOS-style window system (Open, Close, Minimize, Maximize)
- Draggable windows with dynamic z-index management
- Smooth, state-driven animations using GSAP
- Centralized and predictable window state management
- Dock-style application interactions
- Responsive and performance-focused UI
- Clean, scalable project architecture

This is not a static portfolio — it behaves like an operating system.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

### Window Management
- Each window maintains its own lifecycle state
- Focus and stacking handled via z-index tracking
- Minimize, maximize, and restore behaviors mirror macOS logic

### State Management
- Global application state handled using Zustand
- Immutable state updates via Immer
- Simple, scalable, and debuggable state flow

### Animations
- Entry and exit transitions powered by GSAP
- Drag interactions implemented using `gsap/Draggable`
- Animations are driven by application state, not direct DOM manipulation
